This piece of code is for one of the final projects of my Codecademy Course, "Learn Python 3": Section 10 - classes. 

## Brief description of the code. 
We run a restaurant business. And we were given information of 4 different menus in dictionary formats, and some information about the business, like the location. 

We were asked to organize these information so that customers can know information about the franchises, like location and the menu, like which one is available, what items are in there, what the total price was of their orders quickly.
